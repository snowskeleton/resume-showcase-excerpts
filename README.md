# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio. As you may expect with a portfolio, this is a collection of my more well-rounded projects, with short exerpts explaining a bit about each one. So, without further adieu....

# I Got Gas
https://github.com/snowskeleton/I-Got-Gas

I Got Gas is an iOS app written (almost) entirely in SwiftUI. It makes use of the native Core Data iOS ORM, and incorporates multiple UI pages, input sanitization, customizable user settings, and data metrics.

You can download I Got Gas from the iOS app store here: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/i-got-gas/id1528580218

# LTTPoll
https://github.com/snowskeleton/lttpoll
(live example: https://runty.link/lttpoll)

LTTPoll is a StrawPoll clone. Written entirely in Javascript (both frontend and backend), LTTPoll makes extensive use of API calls to retrieve/store data from an AWS backend using lambdas. See the server code here: https://github.com/snowskeleton/lttpoll-server


# RSRSSB

https://github.com/snowskeleton/rsrssb

RSRSSB (Really Simple RSS Builder) is exactly what it sounds like: a program to build RSS feeds. It makes intelligent guesses about which files to include, and produces a verified and tested feed to be consumed by any podcast player.

I use this one regularly myself to generate podcast feeds for audiobooks I've downloaded to make consuming them easier.

# Nobility

Nobility is a Python webapp written with the Django Framework and using a PostGreSQL database. Nobility uses HTTP requests to manage data between front-end and back-end.

# Mir

Mir is a python program that intelligently revereses Rubik's cube algorithms. All features have been fully tested with proper Python testing frameworks.
